# Mathematical problem bank

[Repository home](../README.md) · [Problem bank sources](../docs/problem-bank-sources.md)

This catalog contains **1,022 mathematical problems**.

Problems are numbered consecutively and grouped into volumes of 100 records (22 in the final volume), with a heading, a field table, and any review notes for each problem. **Eligible to claim** appears as a separate column in the index below and as a field in every problem’s detail table.

Some dates are explicitly marked as assumptions or pending confirmation. Formal nominations and award records remain in [candidates/](../candidates/README.md) and [awards/](../awards/README.md).

**Submission requirements:** only complete solutions to the original problem are
accepted. Partial mathematical progress and incomplete Lean formalizations are not
eligible for submission. The catalog records complete solutions only, without
intermediate results. See the [contribution guidelines](../CONTRIBUTING.md#external-solver-and-lean-submissions).

For submission, claims, public review and challenges, follow the
[award process](../docs/award-process.md). Current candidates and review dates
appear in the [public notice table](../candidates/README.md#candidate-register).

## Disclaimer and corrections

Information in this problem bank—including problem descriptions, dates, solution status, contributor attributions, Lean proof records, historical bounties, and references—is compiled from publicly available online sources and the project's summaries and assessments of those sources. It is provided for reference and may contain errors, omissions, or outdated information. Inclusion does not by itself constitute independent verification of a result or confirmation of an award or entitlement to payment.

If you find inaccurate, incomplete, or outdated information, please contact the maintainers by [opening a correction issue](https://github.com/TheJustinSunPrize/awards/issues/new?template=correction.yml). Include the JSP identifier, the information in question, your proposed correction, and supporting public sources so the record can be reviewed and corrected.


## Reading conventions

Each introduction has three rows: **Date proposed**, **Mathematical area**, and **Problem description**. Date proposed identifies when the mathematical problem was posed; it is not an application submission date for this award.

The catalogs retain solution status, Lean proof status, historical bounty, elapsed years, publication details, and scholarly recognition. **Scholarly recognition** records external academic recognition or review of the result. Review notes document evidence limitations and eligibility considerations.

**Current status** uses only **Open** or **Solved** as its status. The index shows the status alone; catalog entries include any complete-solution contributor credits in the same field as **Solved**, after **Proof contributors:**. **Open** means a complete solution to the stated problem is not recorded; partial results and unconfirmed solutions do not change this status. **Solved** means a complete resolution is recorded, including a disproof or an independence result where applicable. Solution explanations belong in **Review notes**. The catalog does not track intermediate mathematical results or incomplete Lean formalizations. **Publication details** records complete-solution references and supporting literature, with titles, dates, venues and links, without repeating author lists. A link labeled **bibliographic record** is a reference entry, not a verified direct link to the paper.

**Lean proof** combines the proof status, source links, and formalization contributor credits. Only complete formal proofs are recorded; **No** means that a qualifying complete proof is not recorded, not that no related formalization work exists. Mathematical discovery, formalization, and **Independent verification** can have different contributors. A repository owner, commit author, statement author, or AI tool is not automatically the mathematical solver. Credits follow explicit source statements or a display convention identified in **Attribution basis**; unresolved attribution is otherwise marked as unverified. A successful kernel check does not by itself establish independent human review or award eligibility.

<a id="attribution-conventions"></a>

**Attribution conventions (updated 2026-09-16).** The 66 records with an **Attribution basis** row describe credits for the selected completed proof version. Each row provides sources and any problem-specific qualifications. **Solver attribution source** links to evidence supporting the listed solver credits; **Lean attribution source** links to evidence supporting the listed Lean credits.

Short attribution notes mean:

- **Paper/report authors:** mathematical credit follows the corresponding author list. This does not establish each author's role as an AI operator or proof discoverer.
- **Repository-owner attribution:** when individual Lean authorship is missing, the owner of the selected completed proof repository supplies the display credit. Ownership or a completion commit does not establish who personally wrote every proof step.
- **Project authorship and evaluation/publication role:** Lean credit follows the named project role in `formalization.yaml`.

Other credits follow explicit authorship or documented participation. Earlier conditional versions and independent proof routes are not accumulated into these display credits. Lists longer than three names show the first three followed by “et al.”; individual AI models are omitted.

These credits do not establish first-discovery priority, sole manual authorship, independent verification or recipient eligibility.

The index preserves Lean evidence qualifications: **Reported; standalone source not located** does not confirm a complete Lean proof of that problem. A linked proof of a related problem is identified as such in the full record.

In the **Eligible to claim** column, **Yes** marks records whose **Current status** is **Solved** and whose **Lean proof** is **Yes**. **Pending verification** means the evidence may warrant further review, but eligibility has not been established. **No** means the record is not currently marked eligible. These are problem-bank screening flags; they do not create a formal nomination, a public candidate record, an approved award, or a right to claim payment. Public candidates exist only as records in [candidates/](../candidates/README.md). Every record displays its current eligibility in both the index and its detail table. For a combined record, partial results or a proof covering only one case do not make the whole problem solved or eligible; the entry remains **Open** until its full stated scope is resolved.

**Claim status** is the final column of the problem index and records whether a problem is available to claim and whether applications for both contribution types have been registered:

- **Unavailable** means the mathematical problem has not been fully solved or does not have a Lean formal proof, so it is not ready for award processing. A solver whose complete solution has been accepted may still register an application awaiting formalization; that does not start public review or permit payment.
- **Unclaimed** means the problem is eligible to claim, but applications for one or both contribution types have not yet been registered. It does not necessarily mean that no application exists.
- **Claimed** means applications for both **Mathematical solver** and **Lean formalizer** have been registered. It does not mean either contribution has been awarded. Consult the candidate register and related claim or award records for each contribution type's applicants and outcome.

When a problem is fully solved, has a Lean formal proof, and becomes eligible to claim, use **Unclaimed** until applications for both contribution types have been registered, then mark it **Claimed**. Registering only one contribution type leaves it **Unclaimed**. An application retained while awaiting formalization does not by itself change **Unavailable**. These problem-level flags do not track the two roles' separate public-review clocks.

## Problem index

The **No.** column runs consecutively from **JSP-000001** to **JSP-001022** in display order. The **Problem** column contains only the linked problem title. Catalog headings and anchors use the same number, such as `JSP-000001 · problem title` and `#JSP-000001`. Each volume contains the numbered range shown above. These catalog numbers are separate from the original Erdős problem numbers cited in the sources.
